# Gene Sequence Generator & Analyzer

A simple Python program that generates a random DNA gene sequence and performs basic biological analysis such as GC content, nucleotide count, complement, and reverse complement.

## Description

This script simulates a DNA gene sequence using the four nucleotides:
- A (Adenine)
- T (Thymine)
- C (Cytosine)
- G (Guanine)

It allows users to input a desired sequence length and then:
- Generates a random DNA sequence
- Calculates GC content
- Counts nucleotides
- Produces the complementary sequence
- Produces the reverse complement sequence

## Features

- Random DNA sequence generation
- GC content calculation (% of G and C bases)
- Nucleotide frequency analysis
- Complement sequence generation (A↔T, C↔G)
- Reverse complement generation
- Single-file Python script (no external libraries required)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard library only (`random` module)
